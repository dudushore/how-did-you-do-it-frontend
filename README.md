# How Did You Do It 🚀

A community platform for creators to document and share the detailed process behind their projects.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5 Semantic**
- **Tailwind CSS** (Styling)
- **JavaScript ES6+** (SPA Router, API Consumption)
- **Showdown.js** (Markdown Rendering)

## ⚡ Feature: Demo Mode (Offline)

To ensure the best demonstration experience, this project implements a **Mock Data** system.
The frontend automatically switches between the production API and local data to ensure instant performance during navigation.

> Configuration can be toggled via the `USE_MOCK_DATA` constant in `script.js`.

## 🎨 UI/UX Redesign (Project Evolution)

This repository contains the functional implementation (MVP) of the platform.
Recently, I conducted a complete **UI/UX Redesign Case Study**, focusing on Dark Mode, user retention, and visual hierarchy.
